Py Dashboards
=============

Platform for web dashboard generation. Predominantly from Google Analytics data.
Created to reduce the headache of pulling data and generating regular reporting from Google Analytics.
This is the 3rd iteration of the platform. Have decided to move to a document storage DB as modeling for various reporting types in relational databases has been a bit of a headache.
